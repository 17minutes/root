\defgroup proof Proof tutorials
\brief These examples aim to illustrate the usage of PROOF


\defgroup ProcFileElements
\ingroup proof
\brief Class to hold information about the processed elements of a file

Used for testing.

\defgroup ProofAux
\ingroup proof
\brief Selector used for auxiliary actions in the PROOF tutorials

\defgroup ProofEvent
\ingroup proof
\brief Selector for generic processing with Event

Example of TSelector implementation to do generic
processing with the test 'Event' structure.
See tutorials/proof/runProof.C, option "event", for an
example of how to run this selector.

\defgroup ProofEventProc 
\ingroup proof
\brief Selector to process trees containing Event structures

Example of TSelector implementation to process trees
containing 'Event' structures, e.g. the files under
http://root.cern.ch/files/data .
See tutorials/proof/runProof.C, option "eventproc", for
an example of how to run this selector.

\defgroup ProofFriends
\ingroup proof
\brief Selector to process tree friends

Example of TSelector implementation to process tree friends in PROOF.
See tutorials/proof/runProof.C, option "eventproc", for
an example of how to run this selector.

\defgroup ProofNtuple
\ingroup proof
\brief Selector to fill a simple ntuple

Example of TSelector implementation to do generic processing
(filling a simple ntuple, in this case).
See tutorials/proof/runProof.C, option "ntuple", for an
example of how to run this selector.

\defgroup ProofPythia
\ingroup proof
\brief Selector to generate Monte Carlo events with Pythia8

Example of TSelector implementation to do a Monte Carlo
generation using Pythia8.
See tutorials/proof/runProof.C, option "pythia8", for an
example of how to run this selector.

\defgroup ProofSimple
\ingroup proof
\brief Selector to fill a set of histograms

Example of TSelector implementation to do generic processing (filling a
set of histograms in this case).
See tutorials/proof/runProof.C, option "simple", for an
example of how to run this selector.

\defgroup ProofSimpleFile
\ingroup proof
\brief Selector to fill a set of histograms and merging via file

Example of TSelector implementation to do generic processing
(filling a set of histograms in this case) and merging via
a file, with part of the objects saved in a sub-directory.
See tutorials/proof/runProof.C, option "simplefile", for an
example of how to run this selector.

\defgroup ProofStdVec
\ingroup proof
\brief Selector for generic processing with stdlib collections

Example of TSelector implementation to do generic
processing with stdlib collections.
See tutorials/proof/runProof.C, option "stdlib", for an
example of how to run this selector.
