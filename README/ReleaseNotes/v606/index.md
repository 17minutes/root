## Core Libraries

### Dictionary generation

Fixed the dictionary generation in the case of class inside a namespace
marked inlined.

### TDirectory::TContext

We added a default constructor to TDirectory::TContext which record the current directory
and will restore it at destruction time and does not change the current directory.

The constructor for TDirectory::TContext that takes a single TDirectory pointer as
an argument was changed to set gDirectory to zero when being passed a null pointer;
previously it was interpreting a null pointer as a request to *not* change the current
directory - this behavior is now implement by the default constructor.

## I/O Libraries

### hadd

We extended the `hadd` options to allow more control on the compression settings use for the
output file.  In particular the new option -fk allows for a copy of the input
files with no decompressions/recompression of the TTree baskets even if they
do not match the requested compression setting.

New options:

- `-ff` allows to force the compression setting to match the one from the first input
- `-fk[0-209]` allows to keep all the basket compressed as is and to compress the meta data with the given compression setting or the compression setting of the first input file.
- `-a` option append to existing file
- The verbosity level is now optional after -v
