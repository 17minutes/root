\defgroup eg The particles related classes

\brief This directory contains classes with interfaces to the Particle Data Group (PDG)
data base, a static and dynamic particle class and a decay class framework.

These classes are extensively used in the VMC (Virtual Monte Carlo). See also
the [link to vmc module]

========================

\defgroup pythia6 The Pythia6 interface

\brief The pythia6 directory is an interface to the F77 version of Pythia 6.2
event generators, written by T.Sjostrand.

The complete Pythia6 documentation can be found at:

pythia8/../index.md
========================

\defgroup pythia8 The Pythia8 interface

\brief The pythia8 directory is an interface to the C++ version of Pythia 8.1
event generators, written by T.Sjostrand.

The user is assumed to be familiar with the Pythia8 package.
Only a basic interface to Pythia8 is provided. Because Pythia8 is
also written in C++, its functions/classes can be called directly from a
compiled C++ script.
To call Pythia functions not available in this interface a dictionary must
be generated.

See $ROOTSYS/tutorials/pythia/pythia8.C for an example of use from ROOT 
interpreter.

done, I suggest just to make the title shorter:
